Lake is a browser-based rich text editor designed for creating content such as blogs, comments, and emails. It tries to keep a balance between being feature-rich and lightweight, and also provides an easy-to-use programming interface that supports further extension.

## Why?

There are tons of editors, but they often either lack key features or are not open enough. It is difficult to find an editor that completely fits your business needs. There are usually two kinds of editors:

* Basic editors: These lack some features that are essential to you. To add these features, you have to spend a lot of time on customizing, and the people who do this work need to possess advanced programming skills.

* Commercial editors: These usually offer the features you need, but have complex structures, making customization difficult. Most importantly, integrating them into a commercial application requires purchasing a license.

Lake's goal is to provide as many features as we can, and it is released under the MIT license, which means you can use it for free for commercial use.
