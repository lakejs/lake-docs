Lake is a browser-based rich text editor designed for creating content such as blogs, comments, and emails. Lake aims to find the right balance between being feature-rich and lightweight, and also provides an easy-to-use programming interface that supports further extension.

## Why?

There are tons of editors, but they often either lack essential features or are not open enough. It is difficult to find an editor that perfectly fits your business needs. There are usually two kinds:

* Basic editors: These editors might lack some features that are essential to you. To add these features, you have to spend a lot of time on customizing them, and the people who do this work need to have advanced programming skills.

* Commercial editors: These editors usually provide the features you need, but have very complex structures, making customization difficult. Most importantly, integrating them into your commercial application needs purchasing a commercial license, or you will face some limitations.

Lake's goal is to provide as many features as we can, and it is released under the MIT license, which means you can use it for free for commercial use.
