## What is Lake?

Lake is a rich text editor for the web. It has a good user experience and provides easy-to-use programming interface to allow further extension.

## Why?

There are already hundreds of editors on the Internet, so there seems to be no point to develop another one. But if you look into them closely, you will find that there are in fact only two types of editors.

The first type is less-featured. They lack some features that are essential to your product. So to meet the needs of your product, you have to do a lot of work to customize or develop extensions. And people who do these jobs must have advanced programming skills around editor.

The second type is commercial. They usually provide many features, but there are some limitations to integrating them into your commercial product. Of course purchasing a commercial license is needed.

Lake aims to be a full-featured, user-friendly editor, and is released under the MIT license which puts very few restrictions on commercial use.
