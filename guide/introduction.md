Lake is a browser-based rich text editor designed for creating content like blogs, comments, and emails. It strikes a balance between being feature-rich and lightweight, offering an easy-to-use programming interface for easy customization and extension.

## Why?

There are tons of editors available, but they often either lack essential features or are not open enough. Finding an editor that fully meets your needs can be challenging. Generally, editors fall into two categories:

* Basic editors: These editors often lack features essential to your needs. Adding these features requires significant time for customization, and the people doing this work need to have advanced programming skills.

* Commercial editors: While these editors usually provide the necessary features, their complex structures make customization difficult. Most importantly, integrating them into a commercial application often requires purchasing a license.

Lake's goal is to provide as many features as possible, and it is released under the MIT license, allowing free use for commercial purposes.
