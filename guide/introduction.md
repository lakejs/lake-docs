Lake is a browser-based rich text editor designed for creating content like blogs, comments, and emails. Lake provides an easy-to-use programming interface that supports further extension.

## Why?

There are tons of editors available, creating another one seem like a waste of time. But when you need an editor, you examine them closely, they usually fall into two categories:

* Basic editors: These might lack some features that is essential to you. To add these features, you have to spend a lot of time to customize or develop them, and the people who do this work need to have advanced programming skills.

* Commercial editors: These usually provide many features, but have very complex structures, making customization difficult. Most importantly, integrating them into a commercial product often needs a commercial license that you need to buy, or you will face some limitations.

Lake's goal is to provide as many features as we can, and it is released under the MIT license, which means you can use it for free for commercial use.
