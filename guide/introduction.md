## What is Lake?

Lake is a rich text editor for the web. It offers a great user experience and has an easy-to-use programming interface to allow further extension.

## Why create Lake?

With hundreds of editors already available on the Internet, creating another one might seem unnecessary. However, if you take a closer look, you will find that these editors can be categorized into just two types.

* Insufficient type: They lack some important features that your product needs. To meet these requirements, you have to put in a lot of effort to customize or develop additional features. Plus, the people doing this work need to have advanced programming skills.

* Commercial type: These editors usually come with lots of features, but they are often hard to customize and load slowly because they are large. Plus, you need to buy a commercial license to fully integrate them into your product, or you will face some limitations.

Lake aims to be a feature-rich, lightweight editor and is released under the MIT license, which puts very few restrictions on commercial use.
