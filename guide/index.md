Lake is a browser-based rich text editor designed for creating content such as blogs, comments, and emails. It tries to keep a balance between being feature-rich and lightweight, offering an easy-to-use programming interface for further extension.

## Why?

There are many editors out there, but they often either lack key features or are not open enough, finding one that fully fits your needs can be challenging. There are usually two types:

* Basic: These editors often lack some features that are essential to you. You need to spend a lot of time to add these features, and the people who do this work need to have advanced programming skills to customize.

* Commercial: These editors usually have the necessary features, but it is not easy to customize because of their complex structures. Most importantly, they require a paid license for commercial use.

Lake aims to provide as many features as possible while being free for commercial use.
