Lake is a browser-based rich text editor designed for creating content like blogs, comments, and emails. It strikes a balance between being feature-rich and lightweight, offering an easy-to-use programming interface for further extension.

## Why?

There are tons of editors available, but they often lack essential features or are not open enough. Finding an editor that fully fits your needs can be difficult. These editors usually fall into two types:

* Basic: These editors often lack some features that are essential to you. You need to spend a lot of time to add these features, and the people who do this work need to have advanced programming skills to customize.

* Commercial: These editors usually provide the necessary features, but it is not easy to customize because of complex structures. Most importantly, they require a paid license for commercial use.

Lake aims to provide as many features as possible and is free for commercial use.
